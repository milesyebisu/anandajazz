Pianist Composer Abi Romero Ramirez had been a tenured professor in the prestigious Universidad de los Andes since 1999, as the Director of the History of Music and Latin-American Music Chair. 
Born in the Venezuelan Andes, he obtained a Bachelor in Music Degree from Universidad Cecilio Acosta in 1993. In 2005 he moved to the Bay Area to pursue Graduate Studies at SJSU, where, in 2007, he graduated Summa Cum Laude with a Master of Arts (Jazz Performance). He stayed at SJSU as a guest lecturer until 2008, teaching Music of Latin-American Cultures and Music Systems. 
Back in his native country, he has produced two editions of the Merida International Jazz & Blues Festivals (&#39;09 and &#39;11).<br><br>

Along with his concert and academic career, Abi Romero is a well-known Film/TV Music Composer, with more than 30 short films and TV specials scored. 
He won the Best Music Award in a short film at the MTD International Film Festival (2014) and most recently was nominated for Best Film Score in three International Film Festivals.<br><br>
 
He recently moved back to San Jose, in self-exile due to the political persecution of the Venezuelan communist government against academic professors, artist and intellectuals from the opposition. <br><br>
