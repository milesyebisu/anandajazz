Ananda Jazz Ensemble was born in 1998 as part of the Jazz Club Merida (Venezuela), both founded and directed by pianist/composer Abi Romero Ramirez. Since its conception, Ananda Jazz has appeared on stage in many forms; from a solo performance to small and even orchestral ensembles. Just as this lack of restrictions has allowed the band to work with great performers from all over the world, the music they play also represents the freedom of combining different colors, flavors, rhythms, styles, and instruments, all co-existing under the great embrace of Jazz.<br><br>
 
In its 17 year musical journey, Ananda has been a crucial part of Venezuela&#39s Jazz development. The band has given concerts in Venezuela&#39s most prestigious concert halls as well as appearing in numerous major Jazz & Blues Festivals. Outside its native country, the ensemble has performed throughout the California Bay Area; most notably at the SJSU Listening Hour Concert Series, Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, and cultural venues in Berkeley, San Francisco, Monterey, and Carmel.<br><br>

More than 100 musicians have been part of the band, and now we introduce you to the latest line up of this new Ananda Jazz Ensemble:<br>
Abi Romero Ram&iacute;rez; Piano.<br>
Satoru Tagawa; Bass.<br>
Kosuke Okamura; Drums.<br>
